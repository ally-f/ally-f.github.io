        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Ally <span class="prns">(they/them)</span>, and I'm a software developer. I love all things full-stack, especially front-end development. I'm passionate about learning new things, coding and otherwise, and I love being challenged and improving my skills. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and improve through working on various projects.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for checking out my website; I'm excited to share my work with you!</p>

        </span>
        <h3>Education and Work</h3>
        <p>I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Stockton University (Fall 2018 - Fall 2022). I started with HTML and CSS in middle school and fell in love with it instantly. Since then, I created and published various website designs both from scratch (like this one!) and using frameworks, like Bootstrap.</p> 
            
        <p>I eventually picked up Java and Python during college and have built various kinds of projects using them, ranging from fun object-oriented card games, to machine learning, to scalable three-tier solutions.</p>

        <p>After college, I began work in software quality assurance at Power Home Remodeling, where I have found various ways to utilize coding as an invaluable tool. I am on two software development teams for the Corporate Finance sector of the company. Working with stakeholders in Accounting and Payroll, I frequently create queries the MySQL database to create test data and observe changes. I also write Ruby scripts to expedite the process of testing, especially when comparing data from different sources. One of my favorite parts of the role is finding solutions to new problems with code and queries, as well as figuring out how to reuse processes for maximum efficiency!</p>

        <p>For some examples of projects I've worked on, see <a href="#projects">my projects</a>!</p>

        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>In my free time, I like to write, play video games, scrapbook, and learn other languages (especially Japanese, French, and Russian!). I also have a cat named Triangle =^.^=.</p>
