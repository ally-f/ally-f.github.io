        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Ally <span class="prns">(they/them)</span>, and I'm a software developer. I love all things full-stack, especially front-end development. I'm passionate about learning new things, coding and otherwise. I love being challenged and improving my skills; I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn through working on various projects.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for checking out my website; I'm excited to share my work with you!</p>

        </span>
        <h3>Education and Work</h3>
        <p>I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Stockton University (Fall 2018–Fall 2022). I started with HTML and CSS in middle school and fell in love with them instantly. Since then, I have created and published various website designs, both from scratch (like this one!) and using frameworks, like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_bootstrap.asp/">Bootstrap</a>.</p> 
            
        <p>I eventually picked up Java (my first programming language!) and Python during college and have built various kinds of projects using them, ranging from fun object-oriented card games, to machine learning, to scalable <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/three-tier-architecture">three-tier solutions</a>. I spent much of my free time exploring these languages in particular.</p>

        <p>After college, I began work in software quality assurance at Power Home Remodeling, where I have found various ways to utilize coding as an invaluable tool. I am on two software development teams for the Corporate Finance sector of the company. Working with stakeholders in Accounting and Payroll, I frequently create queries the MySQL database to create test data and observe changes. I also picked up Ruby in that time, writing scripts to expedite the process of testing, especially when comparing data from different sources. One of my favorite parts of the role is finding solutions to new problems with code and queries, as well as figuring out how to reuse processes for maximum efficiency!</p>

        <p>For some examples of personal and school-related projects I've worked on, see <a href="#projects">my projects</a>!</p>

        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>In my free time, I like to write, play video games, scrapbook, and learn other languages (especially Japanese, French, and Russian!). I also have a cat named Triangle, also known as さんかく ("sankaku"). <span class="skk">=^.^=</span></p>

        <h3>Intelligent YouTube spam detector</h3>
        <p class="project-blurb">Using: Python (<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">sk-learn</a>)</p>
        <p>This project utilizes the sci-learn library to detect spam in YouTube comments. The training data consists of a pre-determined list of comments, and a boolean of whether or not they are spam. Using this model, the program can be fed other comments to determine the likelihood, in percentage, that they are spam or not spam.</p>

        <h3>Incident report form system</h3>
        <p class="project-blurb">Using: Python (<a href="https://palletsprojects.com/projects/flask/">Flask framework</a>), MySQL, HTML and CSS</p>
        <p>This project is a three-tier solution for a company that needed a system to create, update, and store incident report forms for their Human Resources department. It was the final project of my end-of-curriculum Software Engineering class in college.</p>

        <p>Our solution was designed around the real needs of the stakeholder. I served as the lead web developer for this project: I implemented a basic mock designed by another team member, based on the client's needs, and added much of my own custom styling to elevate user experience - including implementing a mobile-forward design using media queries.</p>

        <h3>Gacha card game</h3>
        <p class="project-blurb">Using: Java</p>
        <p>This project emulates a real, popular "gacha" mobile game (click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">here</a> and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/465429/what-exactly-is-a-gacha-video-game/">here</a> to learn more about these!): a user can "pull" from a pool of cards randomly, where each card has a specific likelihood of being pulled. Data from this emulator was compared against real data I obtained from the game to find potential discrepancies in the <i>claimed</i> likelihood of pulling certain cards, versus the <i>real</i> likelihood.</p>

        <h3>Angular website</h3>
        <p class="project-blurb">Using: Angular 2+</p>
        <p>This project showcases a basic website for a fictional restaurant, including location, menu items, and more. It is written with entirely custom CSS and HTML powered by the Angular framework.</p>
